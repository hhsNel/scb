(Argument 0)
		`svoidptr` `address` - preffered starting address of allocated memory  
(Argument 1)
		`ssize` `length` - length in bytes of the allocated memory  
(Argument 2)
		`sword` `protection` - memory protection of the allocated chunk of memory  
(#defined constant) `SOS_MEM_PROT_READ` - whether the memory can be read
