### Header file to automatically include other header files with slight tweaks
Instead of duplicating code with slight tweaks, its better to follow the DRY principle. 
Including this file, you need to specify the following:

| Defined name | Purpose | 
| --- | --- | 
| SUI_INCLUDE_TARGET | Name (In "" quotes) of the file to be included. Needs to be relative path from this file | 
| SUI_BASE_NAME | The base name, to be tweaked by different SUI_ settings | 
| SUI_VARIATE_FRACTIONAL_0 | If SUI_YES, the target will be included thrice with SUI_TARGET_FRACTIONAL_0 set to sfloat, sdouble and sldouble, and SUI_TARGET_NAME appended with -f, -d and -ld. If SUI_NO, SUI_TARGET_FRACTIONAL_0 will be DUI_DEFAULT_FRACTIONAL_0 | 
| SUI_VARIATE_FRACTIONAL_1 | If SUI_YES, the target will be included thrice with SUI_TARGET_FRACTIONAL_1 set to sfloat, sdouble and sldouble, and SUI_TARGET_NAME appended with -f, -d and -ld. If SUI_NO, SUI_TARGET_FRACTIONAL_1 will be DUI_DEFAULT_FRACTIONAL_1 | 
| SUI_VARIATE_FRACTIONAL_2 | If SUI_YES, the target will be included thrice with SUI_TARGET_FRACTIONAL_2 set to sfloat, sdouble and sldouble, and SUI_TARGET_NAME appended with -f, -d and -ld. If SUI_NO, SUI_TARGET_FRACTIONAL_2 will be DUI_DEFAULT_FRACTIONAL_2 | 
| SUI_VARIATE_FRACTIONAL_3 | If SUI_YES, the target will be included thrice with SUI_TARGET_FRACTIONAL_3 set to sfloat, sdouble and sldouble, and SUI_TARGET_NAME appended with -f, -d and -ld. If SUI_NO, SUI_TARGET_FRACTIONAL_3 will be DUI_DEFAULT_FRACTIONAL_3 |
